# Backend Issue Summary

**Status**: üü° Partially Resolved
**Date**: October 12, 2025

---

## Issue

Backend was timing out on all requests to `/auth/login`:
```
curl: (28) Operation timed out after 5005 milliseconds with 0 bytes received
```

---

## Root Causes Found

### 1. ‚úÖ FIXED: `authorize` Function Not Defined
**Error:**
```
TypeError: (0 , import_auth.authorize) is not a function
```

**Fix:**
- Changed `authorize` to `requireRole` in `devices.ts`
- Commit: `e1f4bc2`

### 2. ‚úÖ FIXED: Rate Limiter Hanging
**Problem:**
- `@fastify/rate-limit` was blocking all requests
- Server accepted connections but never responded

**Fix:**
- Temporarily disabled rate limiting in `plugins/index.ts`
- Backend now responds to `/health` endpoint successfully

### 3. üü° PARTIAL: Auth Endpoints Hanging  
**Current Status:**
- `/health` endpoint works ‚úÖ
- `/auth/login` accepts request but never sends response
- Backend logs show: `"statusCode": null` (response not sent)
- Request completes in ~6 seconds but client gets timeout

---

## What's Working

‚úÖ Backend starts successfully
‚úÖ All database connections working
‚úÖ Health endpoint responds
‚úÖ Requests are received and processed

---

## What's Not Working

‚ùå Auth endpoints (`/auth/login`, `/auth/register`) hang
‚ùå Response is generated but never sent to client
‚ùå Backend shows `statusCode: null` in logs

---

## Likely Cause

The auth service or routes are likely hanging on:
- Database query (PostgreSQL)
- Redis operation (Dragonfly)
- Async function not awaiting properly
- Response not being sent (`reply.send()` missing?)

---

## Next Steps to Debug

1. **Add debug logging** to auth routes
2. **Check async/await** in `auth-v2.ts`
3. **Test database queries** directly
4. **Simplify auth endpoint** to test response
5. **Check if `reply.send()` is being called**

---

## Temporary Workarounds

**File**: `backend/api-gateway/src/plugins/index.ts`
```typescript
// Rate limiting - TEMPORARILY DISABLED FOR DEBUGGING
// await app.register(rateLimit, { ... });
```

**Note**: This needs to be re-enabled once auth is working

---

##Commands to Test

```bash
# Kill and restart backend
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9
cd backend/api-gateway && npm run dev

# Test health (should work)
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Test login (currently hangs)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@example.com","password":"password123"}'
```

---

## Files Modified

- ‚úÖ `backend/api-gateway/src/routes/devices.ts` - Fixed authorize ‚Üí requireRole
- üü° `backend/api-gateway/src/plugins/index.ts` - Disabled rate limiting temporarily
