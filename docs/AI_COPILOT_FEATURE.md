## ✨ Key Features

### 1. **Conversational Interface**

```
You: "Show me all devices with high CPU usage"
AI Copilot: I found 12 devices with CPU usage above 80%:
- SERVER-01: 92% (running backup process)
- DESKTOP-045: 87% (Chrome with 45 tabs)
- SERVER-03: 85% (database query running)

Would you like me to:
1. Create alerts for these devices?
2. Restart non-critical processes?
3. Show detailed metrics?
```

### 2. **Automated Troubleshooting**

```
You: "Why is SERVER-01 running slow?"
AI Copilot: Analyzing SERVER-01...

Found issues:
1. Memory usage at 94% (critical)
2. SQL Server consuming 12GB RAM
3. 5 stuck queries detected
4. TempDB at 98% capacity

Recommended actions:
1. Kill stuck queries (IDs: 1234, 1235, 1236, 1237, 1238)
2. Expand TempDB by 10GB
3. Restart SQL Service during maintenance window

Would you like me to create a ticket with these steps?
```

### 3. **Script Generation**

```
You: "Create a PowerShell script to check disk space on all servers"
AI Copilot: Here's a script for you:

```powershell
Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_LogicalDisk | 
  Where-Object {$_.DriveType -eq 3} | 
  Select-Object DeviceID, 
    @{Name="Size(GB)";Expression={[math]::Round($_.Size/1GB,2)}},
    @{Name="FreeSpace(GB)";Expression={[math]::Round($_.FreeSpace/1GB,2)}},
    @{Name="PercentFree";Expression={[math]::Round(($_.FreeSpace/$_.Size)*100,2)}}
```

Would you like me to:
1. Deploy this to all Windows servers?
2. Schedule it to run daily?
3. Create alerts for low disk space?
```

### 4. **Predictive Analytics**

```
AI Copilot: 🔔 Predictive Alert

Based on historical data, I predict:
- SERVER-03 disk will be full in 7 days
- DESKTOP-032 CPU degradation detected (possible hardware failure)
- Network switch SW-02 showing packet loss patterns (cable issue?)

Recommendations:
1. Clean up old logs on SERVER-03 (automated cleanup script available)
2. Schedule hardware check for DESKTOP-032
3. Inspect network cable on SW-02 port 12

Would you like me to create maintenance tickets?
```

### 5. **Root Cause Analysis**

```
You: "Analyze the outage that happened last night"
AI Copilot: Analyzing incident from 2025-10-08 02:15 AM...

Timeline:
02:15:23 - FIREWALL-01 CPU spike to 98%
02:15:45 - DDoS attack detected (15,000 req/sec)
02:16:12 - Auto-mitigation triggered
02:16:45 - Traffic normalized
02:17:00 - All services restored

Root Cause: DDoS attack from botnet
Attack Vector: HTTP flood on /api/login endpoint
Impact: 45 seconds of degraded service
Mitigation: Auto-scaling + CloudFlare protection activated

Recommendations:
1. ✅ Already implemented: Rate limiting on login endpoint
2. Consider: Additional WAF rules for API protection
3. Consider: Increase auto-scale thresholds

Full report saved to tickets #12345.
```

### 6. **Knowledge Base Search**

```
You: "How do I reset a user password in Active Directory?"
AI Copilot: I found this in the knowledge base:

**Reset AD User Password**
1. Open Active Directory Users and Computers
2. Right-click user → Reset Password
3. Enter new password (must meet complexity requirements)
4. Check "User must change password at next logon"

Alternatively, use PowerShell:
```powershell
Set-ADAccountPassword -Identity username -Reset
```

Related articles:
- Password Policy Configuration
- Bulk User Password Reset
- Self-Service Password Reset Setup

Need me to create a step-by-step ticket?
```

### 7. **Automated Documentation**

```
AI Copilot: I've automatically generated documentation for:
- New server deployment: SERVER-08
- Network configuration changes on VLAN-25
- Software updates applied to 145 workstations

Documentation includes:
✅ Configuration details
✅ Change history
✅ Rollback procedures
✅ Related tickets

All documentation synced to IT Glue.
