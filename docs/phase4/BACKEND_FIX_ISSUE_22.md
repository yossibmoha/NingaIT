# Backend Fix for Issue #22

## Problem
Registration was returning 501 error:
```
POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/register 501 (Not Implemented)
```

## Root Cause
The routes were importing `./auth` which had placeholder implementations:
```typescript
reply.code(501).send({
  error: 'Not implemented yet',
  message: 'User registration will be implemented in the auth service'
});
```

## Solution
Changed `backend/api-gateway/src/routes/index.ts` to use `./auth-v2`:
```typescript
// Before
import authRoutes from './auth';

// After
import authRoutes from './auth-v2'; // Use auth-v2 which has full implementation
```

The `auth-v2.ts` file has complete implementations of:
- POST /auth/register
- POST /auth/login
- POST /auth/logout
- POST /auth/refresh
- GET /auth/me

## To Test
1. **Start backend** (in new terminal):
```bash
cd /Users/omc-office/NinjaIT/backend/api-gateway
npm run dev
```

2. **Test registration** (after backend starts):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email":"test@example.com",
    "password":"password123",
    "fullName":"Test User",
    "organizationName":"Test Org"
  }'
```

Should return 201 with user data and tokens!

## Status
✅ Code fixed and committed
⏳ Needs backend restart to apply
