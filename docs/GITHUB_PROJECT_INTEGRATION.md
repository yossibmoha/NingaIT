   - Add to project (auto-moves to "Todo")
   ```

2. **Start Work**
   ```bash
   # Move issue to "In Progress" on project board
   git checkout -b feature/issue-number-description
   ```

3. **Make Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: description (closes #123)"
   git push origin feature/issue-number-description
   ```

4. **Create Pull Request**
   ```
   - Create PR on GitHub
   - Link to issue using "Closes #123" in description
   - PR automatically moves to "Review" column
   - Request review from team members

4. **Auto-link**: PRs to related issues
5. **Auto-close**: Issues when PR merges

### Project Workflows

Enable these built-in workflows:

1. **Item added to project**
   - Status: Set to "Todo"

2. **Item closed**
   - Status: Set to "Done"

3. **Pull request merged**
   - Status: Set to "Done"
   - Close linked issues

4. **Item reopened**
   - Status: Set to "Todo"

## 📈 Tracking Progress

### Metrics to Track

1. **Velocity**: Issues completed per week
2. **Cycle Time**: Time from "In Progress" to "Done"
3. **Lead Time**: Time from "Created" to "Done"
